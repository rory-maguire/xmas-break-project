# PLAN

I want to create my first project about something that interests me and that would benefit me

I am creating an app that basically would keep a track of my record collection (artist, label, genre, year, country)

My idea is to create a database on heroku and the tables would be fullfilling the above criteria using SQL skills.

I shall join this to a front end where I can GET my record collection to display on my webpage in nice format, images, maybe one day have audio files etc.

I can add more records to my collection etc.

//first things first, create appropriate tables
//create RESTful API endpoints which can deal with HTTP requests such as get and post, delete to retrieve data
//hook up to a front end somehow
//wing the rest
