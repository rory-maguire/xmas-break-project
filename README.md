# xmas-break-project

My first ever full stack project after about 6 weeks on the bootcamp

I love collecting records (deep house/techno) so this application is supposed to help me keep track of what I own, what I have in digital form, my favorite records,  and so on.

It is a PERN stack application with CRUD routes
